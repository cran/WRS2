The \pkg{WRS2} package provides wrapper functions for the \pkg{WRS} package such that these functions can be applied in a user-friendly manner.
It interfaces various functions in the \pkg{WRS} package in terms of easy-to-use input arguments and corresponding S3 methods for presenting 
the output. Several robust ANOVA and ANCOVA functions have been implemented so far. Additional functions will be added subsequently.
